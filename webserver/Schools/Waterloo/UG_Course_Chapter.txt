Foundations of Entrepreneurial Practice
Successful entrepreneurs combine intellectual rigour with innovation to create solutions that have impact. It is a process that
starts with a search for "big ideas" using tools such as research, observation, and appreciative inquiry. Next, entrepreneurs
analyze situations and apply creativity techniques to develop solutions. Finally, solutions are tested against business drivers
including customer value propositions, customer identification, channel selection, and resource needs. This course covers the
three steps that form the foundation of all entrepreneurial success: big ideas, solutions, and testing. Because of its broad scope,
the course is valuable to students from different academic backgrounds, entrepreneurship interests, and program level.

(W I L F R I D L A U R I E R U N I V E R S I T Y)
Notes
1. All BUS courses are offered by the School of Business and Economics (SBE) at Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU). Such courses have course prefix
"BU" at WLU, but appear with prefix "BUS" on University of Waterloo (Waterloo) records with "W" attached to the course number (e.g., BU111 at
WLU vs. BUS 111W at Waterloo).
2. Waterloo students taking courses at WLU pay tuition fees to Waterloo as part of a special "Cross-Registration Agreement" between the two
universities.
3. Only students enrolled in Waterloo undergraduate degree programs are eligible to cross register for BUS courses. These courses are not open to
Waterloo Post-Degree or Non-Degree students, including exchange students at Waterloo from another university.
4. BUS courses are normally available to Waterloo students only when there is no equally suitable course available at Waterloo and access is always
conditional upon space availability. WLU, of course, gives enrolment priority to its own students.
5. If there are more Waterloo student requests for a BUS course than the WLU SBE can accommodate, priority for enrolment will normally be given to
students for whom the course is a degree requirement in their Waterloo academic plan.
6. Waterloo students should attempt to self-enrol on Quest for on-campus sections of BUS courses in the same way they do for Waterloo courses.
Consult the web site in 8. for enrolment in Online Learning sections of BUS courses and for procedures to follow when attempts at Quest
self-enrolment in on-campus sections have been unsuccessful.
7. Course descriptions for BUS courses can be found in the WLU Undergraduate Calendar. The requisites in that Calendar, of course, are for WLU
students. Waterloo students should consult the web site in 8. for requisites that apply to Waterloo students.
8. The website www.uwaterloo.ca/math-business-accounting-programs/current-students/business-courses-wilfrid-laurier-university
provides the information below for a large selection of BUS courses (including BUS 111W and 121W), many of which are part of various Waterloo
undergraduate degree programs.
(a) Terms in which the courses are normally offered (both on campus and Online Learning).
(b) Course requisites (i.e., prerequisites, corequisites, antirequisites) for Waterloo students.
(c) Enrolment procedures for enrolling in on-campus sections of BUS courses when attempts at Quest self-enrolment have been unsuccessful.
(d) Enrolment procedures for Online Learning sections of BUS courses.

9. Enrolment in any course, whether it is a Waterloo course or a WLU course, is not officially confirmed until it appears as part of your class schedule
on Waterloo's Quest system.
10. The WLU SBE does not normally waive any of its BUS course prerequisites, nor does it approve requests for class time conflicts.

CHINESE
Notes
1. Students who are interested in the Chinese language courses should be aware that the completion of at least three courses in a subject is
recommended for a minimum working knowledge of the language. The Chinese and East Asian culture courses may provide useful background for
students intending to spend time in the Far East.
2. Students who have previous experience with or who have studied the Chinese language at the elementary or secondary school level should not enrol
in first-year level courses of the same language. Such students should consult the Renison Registrar's Office regarding the appropriate level to enter.
3. Two tracks of introductory courses are offered. China 101R and 102R are beginning level sequenced courses designed for complete beginners who
have little or no background in Chinese. China 120R is designed for advanced beginners who have some Chinese background either in speaking or
writing Chinese characters. The pinyin system of pronunciation and simplified form of Chinese characters are used in all the Chinese courses
offered.
4. Students seeking entry into Chinese courses who have not previously taken a course in Chinese at Renison University College must complete a
Placement Application Form (PDF). Renison reserves the right to allocate students to the appropriate class based on this assessment.
5. Students are not permitted to enrol in more than one Chinese language course at the same time.
6. Renison University College reserves the right to refuse admission to, and/or credit for, any of its language courses to a student who has, in Renison's
view, a level of competence unsuited to the course(s).

Modern societies have had to confront terrible histories of human rights abuses, where one group has sought to oppress and/or
eliminate another because of ethnic, religious, or political differences. Truth and reconciliation commissions, or similar
mechanisms, have shown the power stories have to honour people's experiences and integrate them into dominant narratives of
identity. This course will examine how cultural production (film, literature, and the arts) helps to make sense of these violent
histories and the cultural values and practices that allowed them to happen.

COMPUTER SCIENCE
Notes
1. The phrase "Computer Science students" refers to students enrolled in any Honours plan offered through the David R. Cheriton School of Computer
Science. Software Engineering, Computing and Financial Management, and Bachelor of Computer Science (Data Science) students are considered
Computer Science students. Students enroled in the BMath (Data Science) plan are not considered Computer Science students.
Due to course restrictions on upper-year courses, students pursuing a Computer Science minor many need to enrol as Computer Science students for
part of their undergraduate studies and should contact a CS advisor for more information.
2. First-year CS courses are available to all students with the exception of CS 100, which is not open to Math faculty students and most Engineering
students, and CS 137 and 138, which are only available to Software Engineering students.
3. Upper-year CS courses are divided into two streams.
Courses with middle digits 4 to 9, e.g., 350 are designed specifically for Computer Science students. Some courses are open to all Math faculty
students, but most are restricted to Computer Science students only.
Courses with middle digits 0 to 3, e.g., 230 are designed for a broader audience, including students pursuing the Computing Technology option.
These courses are not available to Computer Science students.
4. In exceptional circumstances, student who are not Computer Science students may be allowed to take restricted CS courses. For more information,
students should contact a CS advisor. Engineering students are not usually allowed to take restricted CS courses that have an Engineering equivalent
available. When space is limited for restricted CS courses, Computer Science students are given priority.
5. Computer Science relies on student pre-enrolment data to determine the demand for courses. Every effort is made to accommodate students who
choose classes during the pre-enrolment period, though space may be limited for some courses. Students who do not pre-enrol may be unable to take
their preferred courses.
6. The terms in which courses are offered may change. For up-to-date information, students should check the "Schedule of Classes."
7. A CS course may not be taken for credit if it is the prerequisite of another CS course that has already been passed.
8. Students who have demonstrated exceptionally strong academic performance can take graduate-level courses if there is enough space and they get
approval from both the instructor and a CS advisor. Undergraduates are not allowed to enrol in 600-level courses when an equivalent 400-level
exists.
9. An enriched version of a Computer Science course, with an "E" suffix, may be substituted for the regular version of that course in any plan
requirement or course prerequisite, or for any other calendar purpose. Whenever a Computer Science course is an antirequisite for another course,
the enriched version is also an antirequisite for that course. A student may not receive credit for both the enriched version and the regular version of
any Computer Science course.
Undergraduate students who take graduate courses that do not count towards their undergraduate degree can sometimes use these courses to satisfy
graduate study requirements. For more information, students should see the "Accelerated Master's Academic Plans in Computer Science" section.

Equilibrium in Market Economies
Central to the study of economics is the concept of an equilibrium in which the actions of individuals are not only
individually optimal, but are also consistent with each other; such as when the total amount of a good that individuals
wish to purchase equals the total amount available. This course introduces students to the notion of equilibrium for a
market and market economy. The properties of such equilibria are explored, both in terms of model logic (existence,
uniqueness) as well as in terms of the desirability of the equilibrium outcomes (efficiency, welfare). Partial
equilibrium (in a single market) as well as general equilibrium (in all markets at once) are covered for models with
endowments, production, uncertainty, and time.

Econometric Theory
This course offers an advanced treatment of topics covered in ECON 322/323 through the extensive use of matrix
algebra, statistical theory and numerical methods. After a review of the required mathematics, these tools will be used
to derive the least-squares estimator for the standard linear model and to conduct inference about features of the
model, checking the results of theory using regression software and economic data. Then this framework will be used
for theoretical generalizations of the model and their estimation using regression software. By the end of the course,
students will be able to estimate a linear model and conduct accurate inference in cases where economic data violate
the assumptions of the standard linear regression model. This includes methods for dealing with heteroskedastic data,
observations that may be dependent over time, response distributions with heavy tails or limited range (such as binary
outcomes and count variables), and observations that may suffer from selection bias.

Notes
1. Normally, Pharmacy courses (designated as PHARM) are restricted to students registered in the PharmD program or who have been admitted as
special (non-degree) students.
2. It is not necessary for pharmacy students to enrol in CECA professional development as the curriculum includes professional development courses
designed to prepare students for the workplace environment.
3. Normally, electives are taken beginning in Year 3. For students who enter Pharmacy and qualify for transfer credits, electives may be selected
earlier in consultation with the Associate Director (or delegate). Independent Study electives require permission of the Associate Director (or
delegate). A student may take a maximum of 1.0 credit as Independent Study electives.

This course examines the interaction of the technologies developed by a culture with the values and social
organization of that culture. The course exposes students to various definitions of society, technology and
values, and it presents alternative views about how the three interact. These views are then applied to a
number of spheres of influence, including patterns of employment and the role of work; medicine and health;
polity and economy; sustainable development and the environment.

Design and Society
The course uses design as a vehicle for examining technology and society interaction, particularly how we
design, create, and choose technology. Design and Society has been created to introduce students to various
methods to help them view design and technology from a technology-society perspective. The overriding aims
of the course are to (a) develop an ability to see through the eyes of others and promote thinking about
technology in terms of users as well as producers or creators, (b) develop critical thinking skills, and (c)
present design and the choice of technology as an activity involving societal and individual concerns rather
than as a purely technical matter. The course does not require advanced technical knowledge and is open to
students of all faculties.

Cities may be humanity's most significant invention, where we shape our vision of the civilized life. At the
same time, the demands of cities shape our lives in fundamental ways. As most of humanity now lives in
cities, the technology of city living increasingly becomes the technology of human life itself. The purpose of
this course is to examine the technology of civilized life, with the city itself as both a technological system and
a scene of technological living. Topics explored include food, transport, cars, architecture, urban planning,
public spaces, sanitation and health, civics and governance, sustainability, and information and

Biotechnology and Society
Biotechnologies are currently migrating from the laboratory to a wide range of consumer products. In
everything from foods to pharmaceuticals, genetic engineering is entering daily life. The biotechnology
revolution will likely have as much of an impact on our lives as the information technology revolution.
However, there is a wide and potentially dangerous gap between research and development on the one hand
and societal awareness of its impact on the other. This course is intended to help students gain a deeper
appreciation for the issues, including ethics, surrounding biotechnology and society. It will do this through an
investigation of such interactions between biotechnologies and society as genetics and the law, foods and the
media, and soil remediation and the environment. Consideration will also be given to the role of computing in
biotech research and in the human genome project.
